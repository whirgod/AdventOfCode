    "<p>You can hear a commotion coming from the kitchen. \"At this rate, we won't have any time left to put the wreaths up in the dining hall!\" Resolute in your quest, you investigate.</p>\n",
    "<p>\"If only we hadn't switched to the new inventory management system right before Christmas!\" another Elf exclaims. You ask what's going on.</p>\n",
    "<p>The Elves in the kitchen explain the situation: because of their complicated new inventory management system, they can't figure out which of their ingredients are <em>fresh</em> and which are <span title=\"No, this puzzle does not take place on Gleba. Why do you ask?\"><em>spoiled</em></span>. When you ask how it works, they give you a copy of their database (your puzzle input).</p>\n",
    "<p>The database operates on <em>ingredient IDs</em>. It consists of a list of <em>fresh ingredient ID ranges</em>, a blank line, and a list of <em>available ingredient IDs</em>. For example:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>3-5\n",

    "5\n",
    "8\n",
    "11\n",
    "17\n",
    "32\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>The fresh ID ranges are <em>inclusive</em>: the range <code>3-5</code> means that ingredient IDs <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, and <code>5</code> are all <em>fresh</em>. The ranges can also <em>overlap</em>; an ingredient ID is fresh if it is in <em>any</em> range.</p>\n",
    "<p>The Elves are trying to determine which of the <em>available ingredient IDs</em> are <em>fresh</em>. In this example, this is done as follows:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Ingredient ID <code>1</code> is spoiled because it does not fall into any range.</li>\n",
    "<li>Ingredient ID <code>5</code> is <em>fresh</em> because it falls into range <code>3-5</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Ingredient ID <code>8</code> is spoiled.</li>\n",
    "<li>Ingredient ID <code>11</code> is <em>fresh</em> because it falls into range <code>10-14</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Ingredient ID <code>17</code> is <em>fresh</em> because it falls into range <code>16-20</code> as well as range <code>12-18</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Ingredient ID <code>32</code> is spoiled.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>So, in this example, <em><code>3</code></em> of the available ingredient IDs are fresh.</p>\n",
    "<p>Process the database file from the new inventory management system. <em>How many of the available ingredient IDs are fresh?</em></p>\n",
